# virtual-pet-test
this is just a test model of a virtual pet im devoloping
This is just a simple virtual pet thats devoloped in godot.
im providing the source code and mac and windows installer on same repository, 
this is my first game devolopment project, and i know i've lot to learn 


\\ the functions of the virtual pet:
it can saty in idle 
or it can follow your mouse cursor
you cannot interact with the mascot 
you can keep that ona all the time as it has mouse passthrough function

you just havr to install the exe file (in windowa) or just open the dmg file and drop the v-pet into applications folder (in mac)


im using a mac so idk how well it runs on windows


the source code is provided in the repo so you can add or delete function to your choice or can even change the mascot
